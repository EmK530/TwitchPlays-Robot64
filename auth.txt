PASS oauth:------------------------------
NICK namehere
USER namehere 8 * :namehere

The script reads the first four lines from this file and uses it for authentication.
The oauth code and NICK/USER lines can be found by analyzing the Twitch websocket connection with your browser.
Make sure not to log out of the account after retrieving the oauth code or it will change.
My tip is to use incognito then close the tab when finished.
